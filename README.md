# train-scheduler

So I wrote this application while away on a work trip in Sydney, Australia.

It was an amazing trip-- talked quite a bit about the course, and all that I'm learning.

And I managed to get a decent version of the train schedule working.

Wish I had more time to add extra credit.

Also, I didn't disable empty submits. I tried to, and the rules when haywire.

I even made items in the form required, which worked in browser, but somehow didn't work as well in deployed version.

The most challenging part about this project was the math.

I decided early on to work in minutes, so that I could have a consistent value across all equations.

I realize it might have been neater to use more of moment.js. I used it, but I didn't use it for all calculations.

There's something about understanding the math fully that mattered to me.

Also, I made a decision on how to handle trains that are coming a day or more later not to build up a complicated schedule. There's no need. But I did create schedules for trains that come at least once a day.

I figure this would be good ground work for refreshing every minute-- but then I ran out of time, and didn't get a chance to do the extra credit.

I submitted the project a day and a bit early, as I'm flying to Brisbane to spend a couple of nights with old friends and their small children.

I suspect it will be tricky to get time to code-- so this week, extra credit might not happen.

That said-- super excited about project work. Love my team, and I've got some cool ideas!
